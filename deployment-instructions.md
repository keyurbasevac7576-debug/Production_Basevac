# Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions - BaseVac Production System

## Your Current Situation
- âœ… Python installed
- âœ… Files extracted to Desktop
- ðŸŽ¯ Next: Start the local server

## Step 1: Locate Your Application Files

1. **Go to your Desktop**
2. **Look for a folder** with the application files
3. **The folder should contain:**
   - index.html
   - style.css
   - app.js
   - (other files)

**Note the exact folder name** - you'll need it in the next step.

## Step 2: Open Command Prompt

### Method A (Easiest):
1. **Hold Shift** and **right-click** on your application folder on Desktop
2. **Select** "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open command window here"
3. **Skip to Step 4** if this works

### Method B (If Method A doesn't work):
1. **Press** `Windows Key + R`
2. **Type** `cmd` and press Enter
3. **A black window opens** (Command Prompt)

## Step 3: Navigate to Your Desktop Folder

In the command window, type these commands **one by one**:

```
cd Desktop
```
**Press Enter**

Then type (replace "FOLDER_NAME" with your actual folder name):
```
cd FOLDER_NAME
```
**Press Enter**

**Example:** If your folder is called "production-app", type:
```
cd production-app
```

## Step 4: Start the Server

Type this command and press Enter:
```
python -m http.server 8080
```

### What You Should See:
```
Serving HTTP on :: port 8080 (http://[::]:8080/) ...
```

**âœ… SUCCESS!** Your server is now running.

## Step 5: Access Your Application

1. **Open any web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. **Type in address bar:** `http://localhost:8080`
3. **Press Enter**

**You should see the BaseVac Dental Production System!**

## Step 6: Bookmark for Daily Use

1. **While the app is open**, press `Ctrl + D`
2. **Save bookmark** as "BaseVac Production System"
3. **Use this bookmark daily** instead of typing the address

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "python is not recognized"
**Solution:**
- Python wasn't installed correctly
- Try: `py -m http.server 8080` instead
- Or reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" or "Address already in use"
**Solution:**
- Try a different port: `python -m http.server 8081`
- Then access via: `http://localhost:8081`

### Issue 3: Can't find the folder
**Check these locations:**
- `C:\Users\[YourName]\Desktop\`
- Look for the extracted folder name
- Make sure you're in the right folder with index.html

### Issue 4: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"
**Solutions:**
- Make sure command window is still open and running
- Check the exact address: `http://localhost:8080`
